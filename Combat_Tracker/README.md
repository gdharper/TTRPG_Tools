# Combat Tracker

A simple tool for tracking initiative and hp during a combat encounter.
Aims to be system agnostic, provided that cahracters in the system have attributes
analagous to the following:
 
 * Initiative - a numerical score determining the turn order of characters in combat
 * Hit Points - a numerical pool that gets reduced when a character takes damage
 * Armor Class - a "to hit" value targeted by opposing attack rolls
